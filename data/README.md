# Why there are 2019 and 2023 subdirectories

This project was first conceived in May of 2019,
and used to produce reports later that year,
using data from then.

With another election cycle looming in 2023,
I am resurrecting the project.
It will need new data,
which will be different not just in content but also in form.
To ensure correctness, the two data sets must be maintained in parallel,
so that they (and whatever they are used to create) can be compared.
