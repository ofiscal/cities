# The deuda data

comes from the data set
"Operaci√≥n Efectiva de Caja 2000-2021",
which is (currently) at the bottom of the main SISFUT downloads page.
That data is an Excel file with three tabs.
I manually deleted the useless first tab
and split the second and third into separate data sets.
All that data is called `ops_de_caja_panel*`, for some value of `*`.
