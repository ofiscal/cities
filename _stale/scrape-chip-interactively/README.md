This folder is probably confusing,
because I had started branches named "gui"
in the two projects tax.co and cities,
and intended to move them in parallel.
Once Juan found an alternative data acquisition method
(https://sisfut.dnp.gov.co/app/reportes/categoria),
I halted progress in both branches,
and so little had happened in tax.co that I deleted its gui branch.
