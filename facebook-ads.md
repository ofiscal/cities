# initial discoveries

Ad space is auctioned on a per-user basis. Each advertiser posts a bid for how much they are willing to pay for, I believe, a particular kind of audience -- such that you can target multiple overlapping audiences, with different bids for different audiences. I'm guessing they take the maximum of your bids if multiple bids apply to the same viewer. Facebook subsidizes relevance, so if your ad is more relevant to a particular viewer, you can win against someone with a higher bid.

You can (must?) also set a budget. Facebook will stop once the next ad would put you over your budget.

They also let you target Instagram, Messenger and "Audience Network". Google says there are 16M Instagram users (v. 31M Facebook users) in Colombia. Audience Network is websites outside of Facebook. Ads on Messenger seem to me like they would be annoying but maybe I'm wrong.

I suspect I could learn faster if I could try posting something.

The pricing remains opaque to me -- I see no per-view price or bid option, just a budget option. However, given a budget of $20 a day (which I guess was the default? it was on the site before I had chosen anything), Facebook estimates we would reach 11K-31K people and get 140-400 clicks. That's having selected all of Colombia as a target audience.

They provide various metrics for seeing how well the campaign is doing. If we want to really test the platform we could just spend that money for a day (conveniently, they offer a "run until <date>" option) and then study the metrics. I think all we would need is a URL to send traffic to, an image to post and some specificity in who we're trying to target.

# post-mortem

They make you select a region with a minimum diameter of 10 miles and a minimum population of 35,000. Targeting specific municipalities was often impossible.

If an ad brings someone to a .pdf, it is very likely (but strangely, not sure) to be rejected. We brought people instead to .html pages that were simple windows onto the .pdfs.
